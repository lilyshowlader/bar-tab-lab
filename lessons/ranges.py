# items = [1,2,3,4,5]

# for item in items:

## the below range will print out 1,2,3,4 (so everything UPTO 5 since this works how indexes work (starting at 0))
# for n in range(5):
#   print(n)

#starting point, upto 10. the output would be 3,4,5,6,7,8,9
# for n in range(3,10):
#   print(n)

# the third argument is in steps of. the output would be 1,4,8,12,16
# for n in range(0,20,4):
#   print(n)


burgers = ['beef', 'chicken', 'veg' 'supreme','double']

## the below would print out all the items in the list in order
# for i in range(len(burgers))
#   print(i, burgers[i])

# for i in range(len(burgers) -1, -1, -1):
#   print(i, burgers[i])
## the above would print out the burgers in reverse
